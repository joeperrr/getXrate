I use this project to learn git and Python3, been awhile since I programmed and the goal of this project is to get the current exchange rate on my screen without having to go to xe.com. 

FYI:

```
$: virtualenv venv3 -p python3
$: . venv3/bin/activate
$: touch test.py
$: vim test.py
```

This will open the VIM test editor on the file
Press `i` to insert new text:

```python
def my_function():
    """This is an example"""
    print("Joep was here")


my_function()
```

Press `ESC` and then `wq` ENTER.

The file is now saved, run it with Python:

```
$: python test.py
```

Thats it ;)
